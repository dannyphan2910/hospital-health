# Hospital Health

This is a Android application dedicated to helping people get easier access to medical facilities (HospitalAroundMe Map feature) as well as to providing features to ensure a convenient and informed health life (with features like CheckUp Reminder and Homepage with health-related news)

This project is a work in progress since I believe in the practicality and social benefits of this application. I want to constantly research and develop more features in my free time. 

For more information (inspiration, screenshots, future plans, etc.), please check out my presentation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nsz-3OCC_EOL9PQdiUxw9AQF73n2OdKj/view?usp=sharing

PS: I actually presented this application as my final creative project for my study abroad program in Hungary 
PPS: The first version of this application (which I demo-ed in class) was finished in 4 days due to time limit
